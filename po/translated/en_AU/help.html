	<h1>Device Driver Manager Help</h1>
	<div class="main">
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>The Device Driver Manager is a tool to help users installing third-party
hardware drivers. Currently Nvidia, ATI and Broadcom drivers can be
installed and allows to install the PAE kernel for multi-core 32-bit
systems. The Device Driver Manager will only list those devices that are
supported. It will not list any other devices than mentioned above.</p>

		<h2>Important</h2>
		<p>The Device Driver Manager can only install drivers that are available in the
repositories. Make sure you have an internet connection if you want to
install the drivers.</p>

		<h2>Commands</h2>
		<p>If you prefer to install the drivers using a terminal, you can use the
following commands:</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h3># ddm -i ati</h3>
		<p>This will install the fglrx drivers for your ATI graphical card. ATI cards
from version HD 5000 and up are supported by the fglrx drivers. Versions
between 1000 and 5000 will use the Radeon drivers. Use "ddm -p ati" to
remove the drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i nvidia</h3>
		<p>This will select the right drivers for your Nvidia graphical card. It will
select the Bumblebee drivers in case you have a hybrid card (both Nvidia and
Intel). Use "ddm -p nvidia" to remove the drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i open</h3>
		<p>You can use this command if you want to revert back to the open Nouveau
drivers. It will remove any proprietary drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i broadcom</h3>
		<p>This command will install the right driver for your wireless Broadcom
adapter. Use "ddm -p broadcom" to remove the drivers from your system.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i pae</h3>
		<p>This will install the PAE kernel on multi-processor systems running a 32-bit
OS. Use "ddm -p pae" to remove the PAE kernel from your system. Note that
you cannot remove the kernel when you are currently booted into that kernel.</p>

		<h3># ddm -i fixbumblebee</h3>
		<p>This will try to fix a Bumblebee install.</p>
